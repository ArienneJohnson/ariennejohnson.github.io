<h1> Brand Competitors</h1>

<h2>Purdys Chocolatiers</h2>


<h3>Strengths</h3>
<p>
For Purdy's Chocolatiers, their logo is very similar to the famous Cadbury's Chocolate Bar logo.
They use purple, which is a complimentary colour to brown and commonly used for chocolate wrappers.
The typeface used was decorative font, similar to script typefaces, and visually reminds the viewer of
the smooth texture of chocolate.
</p>
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>
Their website design is a little complicated, and sometimes the business name can get lost in the design.
</p>

<h1> Brand Competitors</h1>

<h2>The Chocolate Factory</h2>


<h3>Strengths</h3>
<p>
The first colour you see is chocolate brown, which immideiately lets the consumer know that they are a chocolate factory,
and that is what they specialize in.
</p>
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>The logo and colour scheme is great, but their website is very, very busy, and the background is distracting the consumers from the nav, which should
  be the main goal.
