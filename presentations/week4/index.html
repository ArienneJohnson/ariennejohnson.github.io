<h2>Purdys Chocolatiers</h2>

<div class="align-left">

<h3>Strengths</h3>
<p>
For Purdy's Chocolatiers, their logo is very similar to the famous Cadbury's Chocolate Bar logo.
They use purple, which is a complimentary colour to brown and commonly used for chocolate wrappers.
The typeface used was decorative font, similar to script typefaces, and visually reminds the viewer of
the smooth texture of chocolate.
</p>
</div>
<div class="align-right">

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>
Their website design is a little complicated, and sometimes the business name can get lost in the design.
</p>

</div>


<h2> The Chocolate Factory</h2>

<div class="align-left">

  <h3>Strengths</h3>
<p>
The first colour you see is chocolate brown, which immideiately lets the consumer know that they are a chocolate factory,
and that is what they specialize in.
</p>
</div>
<div class="align-right">

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>The logo and colour scheme is great, but their website is very, very busy, and the background is distracting the consumers from the nav, which should
  be the main goal.

</p>
</div>

<h2>Logo Inspiration</h2>
<img class="parrot" src="parrot.gif" alt="new sqwuak logo" />
<h2>How the logo shows what the company is about</h2>
<p>
I want to show that the chocolate company brand is a chocolate company first.
I do not want the consumer to get confused on what the compay is trying to sell.
</p>

<h2>Why the logo is effective for the brand</h2>
<p>
The logo is effective because it shows that it is representing a chocolatier company.
I used the main colours, red, gold and light blue, and I changes the blue background to a neutral chocolate brown.
</p>

<h2>How the branding/logo makes us stand out</h2>
<p>
The colours of the bird, which are the colours of the company, really stand out with the brown.
When a consumer sees the bird wings they will immediately know that this is their company.
