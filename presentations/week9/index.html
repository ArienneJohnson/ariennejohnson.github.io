    <h1> Medium</h1>
    <p><br> 1. The group that presented did a very good job with creating an engaging partner activity, as well as demonstrating their activities
    <br> 2. The slides could have looked more engaging, but the instructions on the slides and the info was very clear
    <br> 3. I thought that the student presenting knew the information and the topic well, and if most of them were away from the podium and now hiding behind the computer, they would have looked more confident and engaging.

<h1>Hard - FeedBack for Chicken Mingle</h1>
1. The colour scheme is very nice and reflects romance, however the text colour can be distracting. Pick a maximum of 3 colours to use for text, and make sure it is contrasting to the background, also have the typeface reflect the loving atmosphere is the site, probably with a serif or script font.
<p>2. The minimalism of the logo is great. Make it stand out by making it larger and more prominant.</p>
<p>3. The sign up button is eye catching. Make it more eye catching by having the background colour bold yet still in the colour scheme. Also center the words SIGN UP in the button.
<p>4. By making the background colours lighter, it will make the webpage more open and welcoming, rather than having the black background.</p>
<p>5. Making the title a similar colour to the background makes it a little hard to see. Maybe try to change the title to white or black so it stands out more.</p>
<p>6. Lining up all of the text and photos makes the website more eye appealing and appear more organized. Try floating some text left or right so they are all aligned.</p>
